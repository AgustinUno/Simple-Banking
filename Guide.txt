in creating a workspace for a cobol project
needs:[all need to be on same directory as your cobol file]
----------
1. "run.sh" file for the command

#!/bin/bash

# Check if the correct number of arguments is provided
if [ "$#" -ne 1 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <source_file>"
    exit 1
fi

source_file="$1"
executable_name="${source_file%.*}"  # Remove the extension to get the executable name

# Compile the COBOL program
cobc -x -o "$executable_name" "$source_file"

# Check if compilation was successful
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Compilation successful. Running $executable_name:"
    ./"$executable_name"
else
    echo "Compilation failed."
fi
-----------
2. tasks.json file within .vscode folder [created when creating new task within project dir]

{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "Compile and Run COBOL",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "bash",
      "args": ["-c", "./run.sh MAIN-ROUTINE.cob"],
      "group": {
        "kind": "build",
        "isDefault": true
      },
      "problemMatcher": []
    }
  ]
}
-------------

Remember to change the file name, in instance the MAIN-ROUTINE.cob
also bind the task with a key for ease
